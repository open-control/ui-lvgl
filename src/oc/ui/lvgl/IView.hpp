/**
 * @brief Interface for full-screen views with system-managed lifecycle
 *
 * Views represent complete screens or pages. Unlike IComponent (which has
 * imperative show/hide control), views receive lifecycle notifications
 * (onActivate/onDeactivate) from external view management.
 *
 * Views are responsible for their content only.
 * External code (ViewManager, app logic) is responsible for transitions.
 *
 * Lifecycle model:
 * - IComponent: Imperative (code calls show/hide directly)
 * - IView: Declarative (system notifies onActivate/onDeactivate)
 *
 * Use getElement() to create scoped bindings that are only active
 * when this view is displayed.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - Main parameter view
 * - Settings screen
 * - Device selection view
 * - Splash screen
